            In many public places like airports bus stands and the places where public security Is more important, 
            usually so many criminals are freely roaming in the public areas. The criminals are highly dangerous and may cause 
            a major damage to the places. To detect the criminals using their faces and creating an alert to the 
            security system will greatly help the system to arrest the criminal and keep the public places safe.
             For that purpose we are developing a project where a criminal will be recognized using the face image
              and will be easily catched by the security system. In our project we are using various image processing techniques
               to match the image with the available criminal database and give the output whether the image is matching with the 
               image in the database or not.
