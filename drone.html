        The project basically uses the programmable DJI tello drones to implement the idea.

       <p id="sum">                       Using python programming the drones can be programmable to automate the working.
        The processor of the drone can be programmed in such a way that it follows a particular object, person or path which will 
        be set by the admin itself.
        A project made in python that enables a DJI Tello Drone to follow a face. It uses a simple resnet10 model to identify faces
         in the video stream from the drone and follow the face with the highest confidence by checking the position of the bounding box.
          It maintains the distance from the face by checking the euclidean distance of the bbox and keeping it between a threshold of 110 
          with Â± 5% tolerance</p>
